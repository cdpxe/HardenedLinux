Nov-29-2007 (version 1.0alpha12)
- exec pre-installation script before unpacking the rest of the package. this
  is needed for the binutils package

Nov-28-2007 (version 1.0alpha11)
- postinst.sh: replace regex stuff in installation script because of problems
  with busybox while installation
- postinst.sh: make paths relative to work with the installer

Oct-24-2007 (version 1.0alpha10)
- ipkg: don't let ipkg install a dependency of a package that is the package
  itself to prevent DoS!

Oct-16-2007 (version 1.0alpha9):
- rpkg: fix rpkg non-absolute path problem (rpkg was unable to find files
  if not started with / as working directory
- rpkg: add verbose output for every file and directory it removes
- docs: update the docs (improve some parts)
- upkg: fix filename of the update file

Oct-14-2007 (version 1.0alpha8):
- uuups. re-implement doinst.sh backward compatibility!

Oct-13-2007 (version 1.0alpha7):
- cpfos: only download the packages, if the user acknowledges the update
  (this makes searches and the update-information faster)
- postinst.sh: don't remove cpfos.8.gz since it is in the current version
  and we need it to link all other doc files against it ;-)
- postinst.sh: also always remove the old spkg manpage first
- cpfos: fix syntax error in cmd check
- upkg: fix var name of the update directory path
- simply make use of the slackware tools when installing a slackware
  package. this will be auto-compatible for future versions since pat will
  always update his pkgtools package and we simply use the needed version
  here.
- upkg: always make an emergency-new-package-file-not-found backup of the pkg
  information file before removing it completely. in the case of a not-found
  package file, auto-restore the old package info file.
- s2hinf: fix var name and fix regex
- spkg fix update_dir -> UPDATE_DIR (like with s2hinf)

Oct-11-2007 (version 1.0alpha6-untested):
- to prevent problems within the package system and to make it
  easier to understand our hybride package system: rename OUR
  pkgtools to cpfos (crazy packager from outa space) and let the
  old slackware package stay with its name pkgtools for backward
  compatibilty.
- also rename pkgtools.8 to cpfos.8 and the config file in /etc
  from pkgtools.conf to cpfos.conf.
- fix filenames in the build, postinst.sh script and in ipkg
- spkg: don't find out the HL version (since we don't need to find
  it out in this tool)

Oct-09-2007 (version 1.0alpha5-untested):
- add cpfos, new meta tool that is used instead of the others
  (it only calls the other tools and makes some checks for more
  usuability)
- added spkg, a tool to search packages by keywords
- added s2hinf, a tool to create pkgfile information from slackware
  package files

sep-17-2007 (version 1.0alpha4):
- implement backward compatibilty to the slackware package format
  by executing install/doinst.sh too, if available

aug-26-2007-2 (version 1.0alpha3):
- upkg: also check for ! ./hardenedlinux paths
- postinst.sh: script created (removes old + creats new links to
  pkgtools.8.gz)

aug-26-2007 (version 1.0alpha2):
- ipkg: don't ask to replace a file if the md5sum of the new config
  file is the same like the md5sum of the exiting file. this prevents
  useless questions.
- ipkg: remove old .new files if md5sum is eq

aug-24-2007-2:
- doc: add a pkgtools.8 manpage

aug-24-2007-1 (version 1.0alpha):
- upkg: wrote the entire tool. package updates are now part of the
  functionality of the hlpkgtools.
- cpkg: This is now a ports system too. Har! Linux with ports + pkgs
  in one package system. This is great (and only took me to code a
  few lines of script code!)

aug-04-2007:
- cpkg: make sure that ./ has permission 755

jul-21-2007:
- ipkg: diff $old $new config file instead of $new $old
- ipkg: even exec {post,pre}inst.sh if they are not chmod +x by using
  /bin/sh ./install/{pre,post}inst.sh directly and only checking for
  -f <script> instead of -x <script>.

jul-20-2007:
- cpkg: set pkg creation architecture ($ARCH) always to i486 on x86
  systems (what fixes kernel build too)

jul-16-2007:
- fix two bugs in config assistant

jul-09-2007:
- fix empty line between elif-else clause in ipg
- fix some var names to upper case on startup pkginf file check in ipkg
- fix leading whitespaces in %deps line in pkginf files used in ipkg

jul-07-2007:
- added /etc/pkgtools.conf
	- added var ipkg_always_keep_cfg
- improved lots of "cat|grep|awk" commands to "awk '/<regex>/ {...}'"

jul-05-2007[2]:
- export additional vars needed by build scripts (ARCH, VERSION, BUILD)
- added permission checks for o+w permission in ipkg
- added dependency support in ipkg

jul-05-2007:
- init the repository with the new versions
