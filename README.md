# HardenedLinux

This repository is a partial clone of my former Linux distribution ``Hardened Linux``. It was a Slackware-based distribution and some scripts might still be useful for today's Slackware users. This repository contains the following items:

- HLHS - Hardened Linux Hardening Scripts: shell scripts to help harden your Linux distribution (especially Slackware)
- CPFOS - My own package system that runs on top of the Slackware package system

## TODO

- make scripts work again on today's version of Slackware and other distributions
