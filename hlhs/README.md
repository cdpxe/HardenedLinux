# Hardened Linux Hardening Scripts (HLHS)

As a part of the Hardened Linux project these scripts make it easy to secure your Linux installation. Since Hardened Linux is based on Slackware, the scripts should work nicely on Slackware, too. I also tested the scripts with Debian, too (tested Debian 9).
